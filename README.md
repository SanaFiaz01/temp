**Libraries for deep learning on graphs in Julia**, using either [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/) or [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/) as backend frameworks.

This repository contains the following packages:

- **GraphNeuralNetworks.jl**: Provides graph convolutional layers based on the deep learning framework [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/). This is the frontend package for Flux users.

- **GNNLux.jl**: Offers graph convolutional layers based on the deep learning framework [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/). This is the frontend package for Lux users.

- **GNNGraphs.jl**: Provides graph data structures and helper functions for working with graph data. This package is re-exported by the frontend packages.

- **GNNlib.jl**: Implements the message-passing framework based on the gather/scatter mechanism or sparse matrix multiplication. It also includes shared implementations for the layers used by the two frontend packages. This package is not intended for direct use by end-users but is re-exported by the frontend packages.

### Features

Both **GraphNeuralNetworks.jl** and **GNNLux.jl** support the following features:

- Implementation of common graph convolutional layers.
- Computation on batched graphs.
- Custom layer definitions.
- Support for CUDA and AMDGPU.
- Integration with [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl).
- [Examples](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/GraphNeuralNetworks/examples) of node, edge, and graph-level machine learning tasks.
- Heterogeneous and dynamical graphs and convolutions.

## Installation  

All packages are registered in the General registry, making them easy to install via the Julia package manager.

For **Flux** users, run:
```julia
pkg> add GraphNeuralNetworks
```

For **Lux** users, run:
```julia
pkg> add GNNLux
```

There is no need to install GNNGraphs or GNNlib directly, as their functionality is re-exported by the frontend packages.

## Usage

Usage examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/GraphNeuralNetworks/examples) and the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/GraphNeuralNetworks/notebooks).
