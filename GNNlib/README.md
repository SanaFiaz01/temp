# GNNlib.jl

This package contains a collection framework-agnostic 
building blocks for deep learning on graphs such as message passing operators and implementations of graph convolutional layers. 

See [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/) for a Flux-based frontend package that uses this library and [GNNLux.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GNNLux.jl/) for a Lux-based one.
