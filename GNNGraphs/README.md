# GNNGraphs.jl

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/)

A package implementing graph types for graph deep learning. 

The package is part of the [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl ecosystem](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl) and is re-exported by the frontend packages [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/) and [GNNLux.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GNNLux.jl/).

## Installation

Install through the Julia package manager.

```julia
pkg> add GNNGraphs
```

## Usage

For a comprehensive introduction to the library, refer to the [Documentation](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GNNGraphs.jl/).
